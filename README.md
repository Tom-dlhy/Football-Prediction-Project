# ⚽Football Match Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the outcomes of football matches (win, draw, or loss) using historical data and player statistics. It involves data exploration, feature engineering, and model development using various machine learning techniques.

## 📑 Project Structure
1. **Data Import**: Loading and inspecting multiple datasets related to football matches and player statistics.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and analyzing correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and evaluating their impact on model accuracy using PyCaret.
4. **Model Development**: Testing various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
5. **Prediction**: Applying the models to predict the outcomes of the 2023 season matches.
6. **Evaluation**: Analyzing model performance and discussing the results.

## 📊 Datasets
- **matchs_2013_2022.csv**: Historical match data (2013-2022)
- **match_2023.csv**: Matches to predict for the 2023 season
- **clubs_fr.csv**: French club information
- **player_valuation_before_season.csv**: Player market value before the season
- **player_appearance.csv**: Player statistics per match
- **game_lineups.csv**: Team lineups per match
